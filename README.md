### How CVCompass will help?

It compares the candidate's resume with the specific job requirements and background fit needs and provides a more accurate analysis of the candidate's strengths and relevancy with the job requirement.


## Some Quick Features (Beta Launch):

**Different options for LLM:** Our application relies on different large language models (currently: Llama3, DeepSeek r1) to review and score the candidate's strengths.

**No Login Flow:** Breaking the extra barrier between the user and the application. Get started instantly; no sign-up hassle.

**Local Processing:** As there's no user-centric database, most of your data is stored and managed from your cached memory.

**Interactive Charts:** Dynamic, interactive charts to visualize the candidate's strengths, weaknesses, and key insights to make quick decisions.

**Personalized Feedback:** Job description-specific feedback and recommendations to improve the candidate's performance.
